It’s fundamental to keeping modern life and the global economy running relatively smoothly. However, the decades-long race to create vastly powerful quantum computers, which could easily crack current encryption, creates new risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "While practical quantum computing technology may still be years or decades away, security officials, tech companies, and governments are ramping up their efforts to start using a new generation of post-quantum cryptography. These new encryption algorithms will, in short, protect our current systems against any potential quantum computing-based attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today Cupertino is announcing that PQ3—its post-quantum cryptographic protocol—will be included in iMessage. The update will launch in iOS and iPad OS 17.4 and macOS 14.4 after previously being deployed in the beta versions of the software. Apple, which published the news on its security research blog, says the change is the “most significant cryptographic security upgrade in iMessage history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,” its blog post says, adding that the upgrade will fully replace its existing encryption protocols by the end of this year. You don’t need to do anything other than update your operating system for the new protections to be applied.\n",

      "Quantum computing is serious business. Governments in the US, China, and Russia as well as tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and IBM are plowing billions into the (still) relatively nascent efforts to create quantum computers. If successful, the technologies could help unlock scientific breakthroughs in everything from drug design to creating longer-lasting batteries. Politicians are also vying to become quantum superpowers. The current quantum computing devices are still experimental and not practical for general use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the computers we use today, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in more than one state. (Current bits are either ones or zeroes). It means that quantum devices can store more information than traditional computers and perform more complex calculations, including potentially cracking encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quantum computers, if deployed reliably and in a scalable manner, would have the potential to break most of today’s cryptography,” says Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher and consultant. This includes the encryption in the messaging apps that billions of people use every day. Most encrypted messaging apps using public key cryptography have used RSA, Elliptic Curve, or Diffie-Hellman algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to the potential threat—which has been known about since the 1990s—intelligence and security agencies have become increasingly vocal about developing and deploying quantum-resistant cryptography. The National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US has been a driving force behind the creation of these new encryption types. Olejnik says tech companies are taking the quantum threat “very” seriously. “Much more serious than some older changes like switches between hash functions,” Olejnik says, adding that things are moving relatively fast given that post-quantum cryptography is still “very young” and there’s “no functional quantum computer on the horizon.”\n",

      "Artificial intelligence is driving us into the era of edge computing — two words you should expect to hear more in the coming months and years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tech giants have poured billions of dollars into the cloud and spent years trying to get customers to move data onto remote servers. Now they're expanding to edge computing, which refers to moving more of the computation closer to the user (the \"edge\" of the network).\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's your smartphone, an autonomous car, or a security device in your home, edge computing means more of the heavy lifting happens on or near the device. That change could lead to lower latency, lower energy costs, and improved privacy and security as less sensitive information gets beamed to some far-flung server.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept behind edge computing is nothing new, but the AI gold rush and improvements to 5G make it a perfect time for the space to take off. 5G lets devices on the edge communicate with one another and the cloud. While 5G had a slow and messy start, recent advancements could prove a shot in the arm for edge computing, which will require data connections to run seamlessly.\n",

      "\n",
      "The latency benefits of edge are crucial with technologies such as driverless cars, which need to make split-second decisions. That's why autonomous vehicles have powerful computers that live on the vehicle itself. The same goes for medical equipment or devices used in dangerous types of manufacturing, where more computing needs to be done on the fly.\n",

      "Article: But what, then, were those programs? Herein lies the most intriguing—and potentially ground-breaking—question that the Pentagon study leaves us wondering: What exactly are the secret compartmentalized programs that the whistleblowers and government witnesses misidentified as being related to UAP technology? What, exactly, are the Pentagon, intelligence community, or defense contractors working on that, from a concentric circle or two away inside the shadowy world of SAPs, looks and sounds like reverse-engineering out-of-this-world technology or even studying so-called “non-human biologics”?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are at least four clear possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secret Tech From Foreign Nations\n",
      "\n",
      "First, what exotic technological possibilities have been recovered from unknown terrestrial sources? For example, if the government is working on reverse-engineering technologies, those technologies are likely from advanced adversary nation-states like China, Russia, and Iran, and perhaps even quasi-allies like Israel that may be more limited in their technology-sharing with the US. What have other countries mastered that we haven’t?\n",
      "\n",
      "A Question of ‘Peculiar Characteristics’\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, what technologies has the US mastered that the public doesn’t know about? One of the common threads of UFO sightings across decades have been secret military aircraft and spacecraft in development or not yet publicly acknowledged. For example, the CIA estimated that the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s accounted for as much as half of reported UFO sightings. And the AARO report spends a half-dozen pages documenting how confusion over subsequent generations of secret US government aircraft appear to have also contributed to the great intergalactic game of telephone of UFO programs inside the government, including modern Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk drones. AARO investigated one claim where a witness reported hearing a former US military service member had touched an extraterrestrial spacecraft, but when they tracked down the service member, he said that the conversation was likely a garbled version of the time he touched an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter at a secret facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are surely other secret craft still in testing and development now, including the B-21 stealth bomber, which had its first test flight in November and is now in testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California, as well as others we don’t know about. The government can still surprise us with unknown craft—like the until-then-unknown modified stealthy helicopter left behind on the Pakistan raid to kill Osama bin Laden. And some of these still-classified efforts are likely causing UFO confusion too: AARO untangled one witness’s claim of spotting a UAP with “peculiar characteristics” at a specific time and place and were able to determine, “at the time the interviewee said he observed the event, the DOD was conducting tests of a platform protected by a SAP. The seemingly strange characteristics reported by the interviewee match closely with the platform’s characteristics, which was being tested at a military facility in the time frame the interviewee was there.” So what was that craft—and what were its “peculiar characteristics?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, the US military has a classified spaceship, the X-37B, that has regularly orbited around the Earth since its first mission in 2010—it just blasted off on its seventh and most recent mission in December—and its previous, sixth, mission lasted a record-breaking 908 days in orbit. The Pentagon has said remarkably little about what it does up there for years at a time. What secret space-related or aviation-related programs is the government running that outsiders confuse as alien spacecraft?\n",
      "\n",
      "A Material Matter\n",
      "\n",
      "The third likely area of tech development that might appear to outsiders to be UFO-related is more speculative basic research and development: What propulsion systems or material-science breakthroughs are defense contractors at work on right now that could transform our collective future? Again, AARO found such confusion taking place: After one witness reported hearing that “aliens” had observed one secret government test, AARO traced the allegation back to find “the conversation likely referenced a test and evaluation unit that had a nickname with ‘alien’ connotations at the specific installation mentioned. The nature of the test described by the interviewee closely matched the description of a specific materials test conveyed to AARO investigators.” So what materials were being tested there?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some puzzling materials-science breadcrumbs wrapped throughout the AARO report. It found one instance where “a private sector organization claimed to have in its possession material from an extraterrestrial craft recovered from a crash at an unknown location from the 1940s or 1950s. The organization claimed that the material had the potential to act as a THz frequency waveguide, and therefore, could exhibit ‘anti-gravity’ and ‘mass reduction’ properties under the appropriate conditions.” Ultimately, though, the new report concluded, “AARO and a leading science laboratory concluded that the material is a metallic alloy, terrestrial in nature, and possibly of USAF [US Air Force] origin, based on its materials characterization.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A Knowledge Limit\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth and lastly is the category of the truly weird: Scientists at the forefront of physics point out that we should be humble about how little of the universe we truly understand; as Harvard astronomy chair Avi Loeb explains, effectively all that we’ve learned about relativity and quantum physics has unfolded in the span of a single human lifespan, and astounding new discoveries continue to amaze scientists. Just last summer, scientists announced they’d detected for the first time gravitational waves criss-crossing the universe that rippled through space-time, and astrophysicists continue to suspect that the universe is far weirder than we think. (Italian astrophysicist Carlo Rovelli last year posited the existence of “white holes” that would be related to black holes, which, he pointed out, were still a mystery just 25 years ago when he was starting his career.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers here could be almost unfathomably weird—think parallel dimensions or the ability to travel at a fraction of the speed of light. And one of the most intriguing questions left by the UAP “game of telephone” is whether there are truly astounding advances in physics that government scientists, defense contractors, or research laboratories or centers could be feeling around that could also appear from the outside to be UFO-related.\n",

      "Article: Jay fell in love with math at boarding school after a supportive physics teacher introduced him to the joy of complex calculus. He went on to study physics and math in college, hoping to one day similarly pass on what he’d learned to a new generation. That chance came in October 2022, when 25-year-old Jay answered a job listing seeking a math expert to grade equations through an online platform. But he would not be inspiring budding young mathematicians like his past self. He would instead be training an artificial intelligence system that may eventually make his expertise obsolete.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Jay, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his privacy, the system he was schooling had been built by a company soon to be a household name: OpenAI. His job was to act as an expert guide for the company’s large language model—a machine-learning system that can convey information in a conversational format, like a chatbot—as it tried to improve its math. From his home in Portugal, he would tell the model if it was taking the right steps to solve math problems, adding thumbs up or thumbs down emojis to AI-generated answers, and sometimes writing out explanations about why the AI had gone wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jay says he knew he was training algorithms for the company overseen by Sam Altman because he was invited to join the OpenAI workspace in Slack. A screenshot he shared with WIRED shows he was part of a group, called “math trainers,” that was set up by the OpenAI researcher Yuri Burda. But Jay was not working directly for the famous AI company. Instead he was being paid by one of the world’s biggest data labor platforms, called Remotasks, a subsidiary of US startup Scale AI, which was valued at over $7 billion back in 2021 and counts OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the US Army among its clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scale AI works closely with its clients to provide and curate the training data they need to build up the AI models behind self-driving cars or large language models. Often, that data ultimately derives from people contracted to Remotasks—which has, according to its website, signed up hundreds of thousands of workers since it launched in 2017. Much of that workforce has been concentrated in countries that offer relatively cheap labor, like the Philippines, where Remotasks says its recruits mostly train computer vision for autonomous vehicles, helping self-driving cars recognize the shapes around them. But in the past year, the company claims the geography of Remotasks’ workers has shifted to the United States and Europe, as it searches for white-collar skills and language specialists to train large language models—fueling concern that these people are essentially training themselves out of a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jay is thoughtful about his role in the future of work. “It’s true,” he says. “I am passing on knowledge that I have and that the machine does not have.” He’s aware that AI models still struggle to replicate the ingenuity with which humans solve complex math problems. But he’s hoping the work he did will help create AI that can benefit, not replace, him—envisioning a future where he could practice algebra or calculus with a chatbot who can match his level. “That's kind of what I was picturing, when I started training these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Willow Primack, VP of data operations at Scale AI, says that Remotasks and others are turning to subject matter experts for data labor in response to the major shift in the applications of AI systems, as these systems start to produce knowledge and content. As the tech industry has rushed to embrace generative AI over the past year and applied it to more sophisticated tasks, data providers have needed a new intake of contractors capable of what Primack calls “expert fact-checking.”\n",

      "DeepMind worked together with UK-based Quantinuum to solve a key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computers: reducing the number of T gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "T gates are essential in implementing a quantum circuit — a network of gates that manipulates qubits to generate algorithms. However, T gates are also the most expensive and most resource-intensive gates of the network.\n",

      "AlphaTensor-Quantum is an AI model that leverages the relationship between optimising T-count and tensor decomposition, using deep reinforcement learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to existing approaches, the model can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation as well as use “gadgetisation” techniques, which implement alternative gates by introducing additional qubits and operations. This way, the AI can significantly reduce the number of T gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the researchers, AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms existing systems for T-count optimisation and is as efficient as the “best” human-designed solutions across numerous applications. It can also save “hundreds of hours” of research by optimising the process in a fully automated way, the team says in the paper.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are two primary means of splitting a log for making shingles (or shakes). The first is radial, like one would cut a pie, and the other is lateral, with all the cuts in the same orientation. Using a froe, the log is split in progressively smaller halves to control the way the grain splits down the length of the log and minimize waste. Larger logs result in less waste and lend themselves to the radial method, while smaller logs must be cut laterally. Laterally cut shingles have a higher propensity for warping and other issues, but will work when larger logs are not available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the pieces are split out of the log, they are trimmed with an axe, including removing the outer sapwood which is the main attractant for bugs and other creatures that might try eating your roof. Once down to approximately the right dimensions, the shingle is then smoothed out on a shave horse with a draw knife. Interestingly, the hand-made shingles have a longer lifespan than those sawn since the process works more with the grain of the wood and introduces fewer opportunities for water to seep into the shingles.\n",

This could eventually accelerate AI models like ChatGPT, which rely heavily on matrix multiplication to function. The findings, presented in two recent papers, have led to what is reported to be the biggest improvement in matrix multiplication efficiency in over a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiplying two rectangular number arrays, known as matrix multiplication, plays a crucial role in today's AI models, including speech and image recognition, chatbots from every major vendor, AI image generators, and video synthesis models like Sora. Beyond AI, matrix math is so important to modern computing (think image processing and data compression) that even slight gains in efficiency could lead to computational and power savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphics processing units (GPUs) excel in handling matrix multiplication tasks because of their ability to process many calculations at once. They break down large matrix problems into smaller segments and solve them concurrently using an algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfecting that algorithm has been the key to breakthroughs in matrix multiplication efficiency over the past century—even before computers entered the picture. In October 2022, we covered a new technique discovered by a Google DeepMind AI model called AlphaTensor, focusing on practical algorithmic improvements for specific matrix sizes, such as 4x4 matrices.\n",
      "\n",

Instead of finding immediate, practical solutions like AlphaTensor, the new technique addresses foundational improvements that could transform the efficiency of matrix multiplication on a more general scale.\n",

      "The traditional method for multiplying two n-by-n matrices requires n³ separate multiplications. However, the new technique, which improves upon the \"laser method\" introduced by Volker Strassen in 1986, has reduced the upper bound of the exponent (denoted as the aforementioned ω), bringing it closer to the ideal value of 2, which represents the theoretical minimum number of operations needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional way of multiplying two grids full of numbers could require doing the math up to 27 times for a grid that's 3x3. But with these advancements, the process is accelerated by significantly reducing the multiplication steps required. The effort minimizes the operations to slightly over twice the size of one side of the grid squared, adjusted by a factor of 2.371552. This is a big deal because it nearly achieves the optimal efficiency of doubling the square's dimensions, which is the fastest we could ever hope to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a brief recap of events. In 2020, Josh Alman and Williams introduced a significant improvement in matrix multiplication efficiency by establishing a new upper bound for ω at approximately 2.3728596. In November 2023, Duan and Zhou revealed a method that addressed an inefficiency within the laser method, setting a new upper bound for ω at approximately 2.371866. The achievement marked the most substantial progress in the field since 2010. But just two months later, Williams and her team published a second paper that detailed optimizations that reduced the upper bound for ω to 2.371552.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2023 breakthrough stemmed from the discovery of a \"hidden loss\" in the laser method, where useful blocks of data were unintentionally discarded. In the context of matrix multiplication, \"blocks\" refer to smaller segments that a large matrix is divided into for easier processing, and \"block labeling\" is the technique of categorizing these segments to identify which ones to keep and which to discard, optimizing the multiplication process for speed and efficiency. By modifying the way the laser method labels blocks, the researchers were able to reduce waste and improve efficiency significantly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"This is a major technical breakthrough,\" said William Kuszmaul, a theoretical computer scientist at Harvard University, as quoted by Quanta Magazine. \"It is the biggest improvement in matrix multiplication we've seen in more than a decade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While further progress is expected, there are limitations to the current approach. Researchers believe that understanding the problem more deeply will lead to the development of even better algorithms. As Zhou stated in the Quanta report, \"People are still in the very early stages of understanding this age-old problem.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are the practical applications? For AI models, a reduction in computational steps for matrix math could translate into faster training times and more efficient execution of tasks. It could enable more complex models to be trained more quickly, potentially leading to advancements in AI capabilities and the development of more sophisticated AI applications. Additionally, efficiency improvement could make AI technologies more accessible by lowering the computational power and energy consumption required for these tasks. That would also reduce AI's environmental impact.\n",

      "The exact impact on the speed of AI models depends on the specific architecture of the AI system and how heavily its tasks rely on matrix multiplication. Advancements in algorithmic efficiency often need to be coupled with hardware optimizations to fully realize potential speed gains. But still, as improvements in algorithmic techniques add up over time, AI will eventually get faster.\n",

      "Article: Ken Tegnell’s first home was on Alcatraz. At the time—this was in the nineteen-fifties—there was, in addition to the federal penitentiary, a preschool, a post office, and housing for prison employees and their family members. That included Tegnell, who lived with his mother and grandfather, a guard, while his father was stationed in Korea. The whole of Alcatraz Island is less than a tenth of a square mile, so, despite all the security measures and “DO NOT ENTER” signs, the inmates and civilians were never very far apart. Yet even given the proximity to the likes of Whitey Bulger, it was a peaceful place to live. The view was spectacular, almost none of the non-incarcerated residents locked their doors, and almost all of them knew one another and shared the camaraderie of an unusual identity. “We were an odd group of people,” Tegnell jokes, “and that’s why I’m strange the way I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Tegnell’s father returned from Korea, the family moved away, and then moved often. But eventually Tegnell returned to the Bay Area—this time to attend Berkeley, which, by the late nineteen-sixties, was another island of odd people. While taking an astronomy course there, he attended a lecture by a not yet famous scientist named Carl Sagan. Interested in things that happen in the sky and unmoved by the hippie culture around him, Tegnell joined the Air Force, in 1974. The military taught him to use telescopes and radio arrays, then sent him to the Learmonth Solar Observatory, at the northwestern tip of Australia, to gather data about the sun. He served two tours there, twelve hours from anything that could be called a city—a godforsaken place, as Tegnell recalls it, but gorgeous, with beautiful beaches, terrific fishing, and almost no rainfall year-round. Whether working or playing, he spent his days there looking at the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is still how Tegnell makes a living, although he hung up his wings in 1996. Today, his job is simultaneously so obscure that most people have never heard of it and so important that virtually every sector of the economy depends on it. His official title, one shared by no more than a few dozen Americans, is space-weather forecaster. Ever since leaving the Air Force, Tegnell has worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center, in Boulder, Colorado: ten hours a day, forty hours a week, three decades spent staring at real-time images of the sun. Eleven other forecasters work there as well. The remaining ones are employed by the only similar institution in the country: the Space Weather Operations Center, run by the Department of Defense on Offutt Air Force Base, in Sarpy County, Nebraska.\n",

      "Regular, Earth-based weather is such a fundamental part of our lives that we are almost always aware of it and very often obsessed with it; it is the subject of everything from idle chitchat to impassioned political debate. By contrast, most people have no idea that there is weather in outer space, let alone what its fluctuations might mean for our planet. That’s because, unlike everyday weather, you can’t experience space weather directly. It doesn’t make you hot or cold, doesn’t flood your basement or take the roof off your home. In fact, until the nineteenth century, it had almost no appreciable effect whatsoever on human activity. Then came a series of scientific revolutions that made certain technologies, from electricity to telecommunications, central to our lives. Only later did we realize that those technologies are vulnerable to the effects of weather in outer space. The potential consequences are as sweeping as our technological dependence. In 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, surveying the landscape of possible disasters, concluded that only two natural hazards have the capacity to simultaneously affect the entire nation. One is a pandemic. The other is a severe solar storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why Tegnell’s job is so important. But “space-weather forecaster” is an optimistic misnomer; for the most part, he and his colleagues can’t predict what will happen in outer space. All they can do is try to figure out what’s happening there right now, preferably fast enough to limit the impact on our planet. Even that is difficult, because space weather is both an extremely challenging field—it is essentially applied astrophysics—and a relatively new one. As such, it is full of many lingering scientific questions and one looming practical question: What will happen here on Earth when the next huge space storm hits?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first such storm to cause us trouble took place in 1859. In late August, the aurora borealis, which is normally visible only in polar latitudes, made a series of unusual appearances: in Havana, Panama, Rome, New York City. Then, in early September, the aurora returned with such brilliance that gold miners in the Rocky Mountains woke up at night and began making breakfast, and disoriented birds greeted the nonexistent morning.\n",

At around noon on September 1st, the British astronomer Richard Carrington was outside sketching a group of sunspots when he saw a burst of light on the surface of the sun: the first known observation of a solar flare. When accounts of the low-latitude auroras started rolling in, along with reports that magnetometers—devices that measure fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic field—had surged so high they maxed out their recording capabilities, scientists began to suspect that the strange things happening on Earth were related to the strange thing Carrington had seen on the sun.\n",

      "Over the years, at odd intervals, this pattern kept repeating: brilliant night skies followed by troubling consequences, which changed in concert with evolving technologies. Teletype machines ceased to operate; or transatlantic cables stopped working; or worldwide radio circuits fell silent; or hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission lines used to send and receive wire stories all went down at the same time. In May, 1967, all three radar sites of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning Systems then maintained by the U.S. Air Force appeared to have been jammed; worried that the Soviet Union was on the verge of attacking, military officials nearly scrambled nuclear-equipped aircraft. Five years later, during the Vietnam War, the United States started sowing the waters outside North Vietnamese seaports with mines that had magnetic sensors, to trigger explosions when steel-hulled vessels passed overhead. Three months after that program began, many of those mines—four thousand of them, according to one contemporaneous source—detonated almost simultaneously. An investigation determined that the plan had been compromised not by Hanoi but by a newly discovered solar phenomenon called a coronal mass ejection.\n",

      "In time, aided by each new technological difficulty, astrophysicists began to piece together a better understanding of the weather in outer space. But science can take a long time to make inroads into public awareness, let alone public policy, so space weather remained a mostly marginal subject until 2008, when the National Academy of Sciences convened a group of experts to assess the nation’s capacity to endure its terrestrial effects. Later that year, the N.A.S. published a report on the findings, “Severe Space Weather Events: Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The title was dry; the contents were not. The report noted that the Earth hadn’t experienced a Carrington-size storm during the space age, or, for that matter, during the age of widespread electrification, and that much of the country’s critical infrastructure seemed unlikely to withstand one. Extensive damage to satellites would compromise everything from communications to national security, while extensive damage to the power grid would compromise everything: health care, transportation, agriculture, emergency response, water and sanitation, the financial industry, the continuity of government. The report estimated that recovery from a Carrington-class storm could take up to a decade and cost many trillions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "That report made headlines, and also made its way to President Barack Obama—who by then had appointed a new FEMA administrator, a man named Craig Fugate. At the time, very few people even within the emergency-response community knew much about space weather. But, by chance, Fugate had crossed paths with the Space Weather Prediction Center earlier in his career; interested in the center’s work, he had made himself into something of a space-weather expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, when the White House came knocking to ask if it should be concerned about the N.A.S. report, Fugate was in a position to offer an emphatic yes. The question, for him, wasn’t whether a major solar storm posed a risk to the nation; it was how best to prepare for it beforehand and recover from it afterward. And so, as he began settling into his job, and getting to know the rest of the senior leaders at FEMA, he made a habit of presenting them with a hypothetical situation. “I asked them what they would do if there was a G5 storm,” Fugate told me, referring to the highest classification on the NOAA Space Weather Scale, akin to an F5 tornado or a Category 5 hurricane. “And they go, ‘What’s a G5 storm?’ ” Hoo boy, Fugate remembers thinking. We got a problem.\n",

      "In space weather, every day is a sunny day. There is no interstellar rain, no interplanetary snow, no sleet spinning off the rings of Saturn; all the phenomena we call space weather originate on the sun. And so, to start, you must shed the idea—implicit in our meteorology and omnipresent in our metaphors—that the sun is a mild and beneficent force, a bestower of good moods and great tans.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, the sun is an enormous thermonuclear bomb that has been exploding continuously for four and a half billion years. Its inner workings are imperfectly understood even by heliophysicists, who sometimes sound less like scientists than like nineteen-fifties comic-book heroes, enthusiastically invoking things like flux tubes and convection zones and galactic-cosmic-ray dropouts. Fortunately, for our purposes, the only two solar phenomena you need to understand are solar flares and coronal mass ejections, both of which stem from the same thing: a buildup of energy in the magnetic field of the sun.\n",

Of course, most of the digital content that we see is in flat 2D, and you need to wear specialized glasses to actually experience those objects in a way that tricks your brain into believing it’s actually 3D. Or at least that’s how things have been traditionally. Outside of cinemas, wearing such glasses is not only uncomfortable and awkward, they’re practically unusable as well. That’s where technologies like the new nubia Pad 3D II come in, offering that same enjoyable experience of immersing yourself in 3D content without having to put anything on your face and without blocking the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Designer: Nubia\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of relying on a projector and glasses, the nubia Pad 3D II employs a Diffractive Lighthfield Backlighting (DLB) layer underneath the LCD screen to have the same effect of sending a different set of images to each eye. It uses sensors and eye-detection algorithms to adjust those images depending on where we’re actually looking, giving the same effect without having to wear glasses. That was the concept that nubia proved last year, and the nubia Pad 3D II refines that design with much-needed upgrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top of that list is 5G connectivity, which is pretty much a minimum requirement for any mobile device today. Given the tablet’s potential for content consumption as well as creation on the go, a fast and stable Internet connection is more than just a convenience; it’s a necessity. Other hardware upgrades include an improvement to the special display with 80% better 3D resolution and 100% boost in 3D brightness. It is powered by some of the current mobile technologies available, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a whopping 10,000 mAh 66W battery, and a 12.1-inch 2.5K screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, nubia is also pushing the AI upgrades it made to the second-gen eyewear-free 3D tablet. In addition to utilizing AI to properly detect eye position and adjust the 3D display accordingly, it also uses neural networks for its Neovision 3D Anytime, which can convert any 2D content into 3D in real time. That includes not just photos but also videos, streaming media, and even games. AI 3D Collaboration allows owners of ZTE phones or Miracast devices to wirelessly stream content to the tablet for even more sources for videos, images, and more.\n",

      "The nubia Pad 3D II is more than just a tablet for watching 3D videos, though. Thanks to an AI-enhanced dual-camera system, it can also take photos or record videos in stereoscopic 3D, letting you easily create 3D content that you can then share with others. The tablet also has a role to play even if you’re creating those 3D images on a different device. Simply drag and drop that 3D model from laptop to tablet for a better way to view your creation. With the new and improved nubia Pad 3D II, 3D no longer has to be something you can experience inside a cinema or with glasses on, opening a whole new world of 3D content that you can enjoy anytime, anywhere.\n",

With today’s technologies and knowledge, however, that’s not easily possible, especially when you need to add powerful computing hardware to sophisticated optics. That’s especially the case when you need to offer some kind of smart assistant functionality, especially voice and speech recognition. In the past, you had to settle for rough translations and sometimes misinterpretations; comical but frustrating nonetheless.

OPPO is laying claim to the title of the world’s lightest binocular full-color glasses, and at 50g only, the claim does have merit. It looks just like regular spectacles with very thick frames, but nothing like those complicated and heavy mixed reality glasses. Despite that lightweight design, the Air Glass 3 still boasts a bright 1,000 nits display delivered by a tiny Spark micro projector, ensuring you can clearly see the virtual information even in bright environments. And with an ultra-thin waveguide, you don’t get the rainbow-like patterns that are often seen on optical see-through displays like these.\n",

      "The OPPO Air Glass 3 manages to offer this more comfortable design thanks to its more focused functions. Rather than trying to cast its net wide with augmented reality, OPPO is instead focusing on “assisted reality” that emphasizes productivity over entertainment. You’ll still be able to see images if you want and control music playback, but the information that’s displayed in front of your eyes is limited to things like navigation, timers, translations, or even a teleprompter. In other words, it’s a sleek way to have all the important information you need right in front of you instead of having to fish out your phone from your pocket and get distracted in the process.\n",

      "Of course, that means it will need to connect to an external device, particularly your OPPO smartphone. The Air Glass mobile app provides that connection you need with OPPO’s AndesGPT to ensure you’re getting the best performance possible without weighing your head down. OPPO is also laying the groundwork for more AI-enhanced features and experiences by investing heavily in its own AI center in the hopes of empowering all its products, especially its smartphones, with these features.\n",

      "The finished document, titled “An Action Plan to Increase the Safety and Security of Advanced AI,” recommends a set of sweeping and unprecedented policy actions that, if enacted, would radically disrupt the AI industry. Congress should make it illegal, the report recommends, to train AI models using more than a certain level of computing power. The threshold, the report recommends, should be set by a new federal AI agency, although the report suggests, as an example, that the agency could set it just above the levels of computing power used to train current cutting-edge models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini. The new AI agency should require AI companies on the “frontier” of the industry to obtain government permission to train and deploy new models above a certain lower threshold, the report adds. Authorities should also “urgently” consider outlawing the publication of the “weights,” or inner workings, of powerful AI models, for example under open-source licenses, with violations possibly punishable by jail time, the report says. And the government should further tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips, and channel federal funding toward “alignment” research that seeks to make advanced AI safer, it recommends.\n",

It was written by Gladstone AI, a four-person company that runs technical briefings on AI for government employees. (Parts of the action plan recommend that the government invests heavily in educating officials on the technical underpinnings of AI systems so they can better understand their risks.) The report was delivered as a 247-page document to the State Department on Feb. 26. The State Department did not respond to several requests for comment on the report. The recommendations “do not reflect the views of the United States Department of State or the United States Government,” the first page of the report says.\n",

The chatbot ChatGPT, released in November 2022, was the first time this pace of change became visible to society at large, leading many people to question whether future AIs might pose existential risks to humanity. New tools, with more capabilities, have continued to be released at a rapid clip since. As governments around the world discuss how best to regulate AI, the world’s biggest tech companies have fast been building out the infrastructure to train the next generation of more powerful systems—in some cases planning to use 10 or 100 times more computing power. Meanwhile, more than 80% of the American public believe AI could accidentally cause a catastrophic event, and 77% of voters believe the government should be doing more to regulate AI, according to recent polling by the AI Policy Institute.\n",

      "Outlawing the training of advanced AI systems above a certain threshold, the report states, may “moderate race dynamics between all AI developers” and contribute to a reduction in the speed of the chip industry manufacturing faster hardware. Over time, a federal AI agency could raise the threshold and allow the training of more advanced AI systems once evidence of the safety of cutting-edge models is sufficiently proven, the report proposes. Equally, it says, the government could lower the safety threshold if dangerous capabilities are discovered in existing models.\n",

      "The proposal is likely to face political difficulties. “I think that this recommendation is extremely unlikely to be adopted by the United States government” says Greg Allen, director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in response to a summary TIME provided of the report’s recommendation to outlaw AI training runs above a certain threshold. Current U.S. government AI policy, he notes, is to set compute thresholds above which additional transparency monitoring and regulatory requirements apply, but not to set limits above which training runs would be illegal. “Absent some kind of exogenous shock, I think they are quite unlikely to change that approach,” Allen says.\n",

      "Jeremie and Edouard Harris, the CEO and CTO of Gladstone respectively, have been briefing the U.S. government on the risks of AI since 2021. The duo, who are brothers, say that government officials who attended many of their earliest briefings agreed that the risks of AI were significant, but told them the responsibility for dealing with them fell to different teams or departments. In late 2021, the Harrises say Gladstone finally found an arm of the government with the responsibility to address AI risks: the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. Teams within the Bureau have an inter-agency mandate to address risks from emerging technologies including chemical and biological weapons, and radiological and nuclear risks. Following briefings by Jeremie and Gladstone's then-CEO Mark Beall, in October 2022 the Bureau put out a tender for report that could inform a decision whether to add AI to the list of other risks it monitors. (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outcome of that decision.) The Gladstone team won that contract, and the report released Monday is the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report focuses on two separate categories of risk. Describing the first category, which it calls “weaponization risk,” the report states: “such systems could potentially be used to design and even execute catastrophic biological, chemical, or cyber attacks, or enable unprecedented weaponized applications in swarm robotics.” The second category is what the report calls the “loss of control” risk, or the possibility that advanced AI systems may outmaneuver their creators. There is, the report says, “reason to believe that they may be uncontrollable if they are developed using current techniques, and could behave adversarially to human beings by default.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both categories of risk, the report says, are exacerbated by “race dynamics” in the AI industry. The likelihood that the first company to achieve AGI will reap the majority of economic rewards, the report says, incentivizes companies to prioritize speed over safety. “Frontier AI labs face an intense and immediate incentive to scale their AI systems as fast as they can,” the report says. “They do not face an immediate incentive to invest in safety or security measures that do not deliver direct economic benefits, even though some do out of genuine concern.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gladstone report identifies hardware—specifically the high-end computer chips currently used to train AI systems—as a significant bottleneck to increases in AI capabilities. Regulating the proliferation of this hardware, the report argues, may be the “most important requirement to safeguard long-term global safety and security from AI.” It says the government should explore tying chip export licenses to the presence of on-chip technologies allowing monitoring of whether chips are being used in large AI training runs, as a way of enforcing proposed rules against training AI systems larger than GPT-4. However the report also notes that any interventions will need to account for the possibility that overregulation could bolster foreign chip industries, eroding the U.S.’s ability to influence the supply chain.\n",

      "The report also raises the possibility that, ultimately, the physical bounds of the universe may not be on the side of those attempting to prevent proliferation of advanced AI through chips. “As AI algorithms continue to improve, more AI capabilities become available for less total compute. Depending on how far this trend progresses, it could ultimately become impractical to mitigate advanced AI proliferation through compute concentrations at all.” To account for this possibility, the report says a new federal AI agency could explore blocking the publication of research that improves algorithmic efficiency, though it concedes this may harm the U.S. AI industry and ultimately be unfeasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Harrises recognize in conversation that their recommendations will strike many in the AI industry as overly zealous. The recommendation to outlaw the open-sourcing of advanced AI model weights, they expect, will not be popular. “Open source is generally a wonderful phenomenon and overall massively positive for the world,” says Edouard, the chief technology officer of Gladstone. “It’s an extremely challenging recommendation to make, and we spent a lot of time looking for ways around suggesting measures like this.” Allen, the AI policy expert at CSIS, says he is sympathetic to the idea that open-source AI makes it more difficult for policymakers to get a handle on the risks. But he says any proposal to outlaw the open-sourcing of models above a certain size would need to contend with the fact that U.S. law has a limited reach. “Would that just mean that the open source community would move to Europe?” he says. “Given that it's a big world, you sort of have to take that into account.”\n",

      "Despite the challenges, the report’s authors say they were swayed by how easy and cheap it currently is for users to remove safety guardrails on an AI model if they have access to its weights. “If you proliferate an open source model, even if it looks safe, it could still be dangerous down the road,” Edouard says, adding that the decision to open-source a model is irreversible. “At that point, good luck, all you can do is just take the damage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The third co-author of the report, former Defense Department official Beall, has since left Gladstone in order to start a super PAC aimed at advocating for AI policy. The PAC, called Americans for AI Safety, officially launched on Monday. It aims to make AI safety and security \"a key issue in the 2024 elections, with a goal of passing AI safety legislation by the end of 2024,\" the group said in a statement to TIME. The PAC did not disclose its funding commitments, but said it has \"set a goal of raising millions of dollars to accomplish its mission.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before co-founding Gladstone with Beall, the Harris brothers ran an AI company that went through YCombinator, the famed Silicon Valley incubator, at the time when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was at the helm. The pair brandish these credentials as evidence they have the industry’s interests at heart, even as their recommendations, if implemented, would upend it. “Move fast and break things, we love that philosophy, we grew up with that philosophy,” Jeremie tells TIME. But the credo, he says, ceases to apply when the potential downside of your actions is so massive. “Our default trajectory right now,” he says, “seems very much on course to create systems that are powerful enough that they either can be weaponized catastrophically, or fail to be controlled.” He adds: “One of the worst-case scenarios is you get a catastrophic event that completely shuts down AI research for everybody, and we don't get to reap the incredible benefits of this technology.”\n",

      "The near miss happened at approximately 1:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, as the two satellites brushed past each other some 378 miles (608 kilometers) above Earth, according to LeoLabs, a California-based company specializing in tracking and analyzing objects in Low Earth Orbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The satellites in question were NASA’s Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics Mission (TIMED) spacecraft, launched in 2001 to study the Sun and Earth’s upper atmosphere, and the Russian Cosmos 2221, a defunct defense satellite launched in 1992. LeoLabs reported that the two satellites came within a mere 66 feet (20 meters) of each other. Considering the speed at which these objects travel–over 17,500 miles per hour (28,165 kilometers per hour)–this was “too close for comfort,” as the company said on X. Both of these spacecraft lack maneuverability, leaving ground observers with no choice but to watch helplessly, without the ability to intervene.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",

      "“Indeed, the two satellites likely passed within 20 meters of each other,” LeoLabs’ senior technical fellow Darren McKnight explained to Gizmodo in an email. “We monitor over 20,000 objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using our 10 phased array radars worldwide. We can identify and update the orbital trajectories of all of these objects several times a day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA, in a statement, acknowledged that, had the satellites collided, it would have led to “significant debris generation.” Such an event would have increased the risk of further collisions in a wide area of LEO, particularly affecting the lower orbits frequently used by satellite constellations and crewed space missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "LeoLabs further analyzed the potential impact of a collision, suggesting it could have generated approximately 2,000 to 7,000 trackable fragments. This estimate considers the total mass, construction, relative velocity, and the angle of impact of the spacecraft. As of February 15, there are around 12,000 fragments in LEO, and this incident could have potentially increased this number by 50%, the company claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such near-misses are rare, according to LeoLabs, with only six events in the past two years featuring a miss distance of less than 66 feet between “two intact, non-maneuverable objects.” Clearly, this latest incident highlights the growing concerns over space debris and the need for improved monitoring and mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of current and future space missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“This event is indicative of an increasing number of near misses in LEO,” McKnight said. “Some altitude regions are worse than others, but generally half of the population in LEO is comprised of fragments and massive derelict objects,” including abandoned rocket bodies and non-operational payloads. Large derelict objects represent just 12% of the total number in space, he said, yet they account for 45% of the total mass. This is significant, as collisions between these large objects can create thousands of fragments, escalating the risk of further impacts. “Lastly, constellations of smallsats are being deployed on a regular basis and their resiliency requires space traffic coordination processes and technologies to ensure their long-term safe operations,” McKnight added.\n",

      "To date, only once has a satellite smashed into another.

      "The animals Colossal hopes to produce will be Asian elephants (E. maximus), genetically engineered to be resistant to the cold and, most notably, covered in shaggy hair à la woolly mammoth, their extinct cousin. Colossal also has plans to produce approximate (or “proxy”) species of the Tasmanian tiger or thylacine, which went extinct around 1936, and the dodo, a flightless bird native to Mauritius, which was gone by 1681. Other companies—namely Revive & Restore—have similar aims with other species, including the heath hen and passenger pigeon.\n",

      "A proxy species isn’t truly the old creature brought back to life. As described in a 2016 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission, “Proxy is used here to mean a substitute that would represent in some sense (e.g. phenotypically, behaviourally, ecologically) another entity – the extinct form.” The group added that “Proxy is preferred to facsimile, which implies creation of an exact copy.”\n",

      "It’s not just a question of having biological material from an extinct animal. Researchers exploring the possibility of ‘resurrecting’ the Christmas Island rat found that some genetics were simply lost to time, in spite of the amount that could be gleaned from historic tissues and its nearest extant relatives. One member of the team told Gizmodo that ​​“We aren’t actually planning to do it, as probably the world doesn’t need any more rats, and probably the money it would take to do the best job possible could be spent on better things, e.g., conserving living things.” (That researcher is now a member of Colossal’s advisory board.) Nevertheless, the production of elephant iPSCs is a step toward producing these proxy animals, an aim that many scientists see as likely but fewer see as useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Colossal produces a herd of proxy mammoths, its intention is to decelerate the melting of the permafrost by loosing the animals on a swath of Siberia. Ultimately, Colossal says, the mammoth steppe—the ancient ecosystem in which the giant proboscideans roamed—could be restored, helping fight climate change and pushing new technologies in gene editing in the process, helping extant elephants, which face their own survival threats.\n",

Asian elephants are an endangered species; to use them as surrogates for proxy mammoths would be the cherry-on-top of an ethical dilemma sundae.\n",

The lawsuit, which centers around the alleged unauthorized use of the Times’ copyrighted material to train OpenAI’s artificial intelligence systems, including the popular ChatGPT, has sparked a heated debate over the boundaries of copyright law and AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI’s defense, articulated in a recent filing in Manhattan federal court, argues that The New York Times contravened OpenAI’s terms of use by using “deceptive prompts” to force the AI to reproduce the newspaper’s content. OpenAI contends that this strategy was designed to create evidence for The New York Times’ lawsuit, undermining the integrity of the legal process. The filing criticizes the Times for not adhering to its own high journalistic standards, suggesting that the newspaper hired an external party to manipulate OpenAI’s products deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of this legal battle is the controversial question of whether AI’s training on copyrighted materials constitutes fair use — a principle that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as news reporting, teaching, and research. Tech companies, including OpenAI, argue that their AI systems’ usage of copyrighted content is a fair use, essential for the development of AI technologies that could potentially shape a multitrillion-dollar industry.

However, courts have yet to provide a clear verdict on the fair use question in the context of AI, with some infringement claims being dismissed due to insufficient evidence of AI-generated content resembling copyrighted works closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI’s filing emphasizes the challenges in using ChatGPT to systematically reproduce copyrighted articles, arguing that the instances cited by the Times were anomalies resulting from extensive manipulation.

A ruling in favor of OpenAI could solidify the legal standing of AI’s fair use of copyrighted materials, potentially accelerating the growth of AI technologies.

      "In 2018, President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on imports of solar panels and cells, with the goal of helping US manufacturers compete with cheaper imports from China and Southeast Asia. The tariffs were requested by two American companies, including Suniva, which had once been the fastest-growing solar company in the US before filing for bankruptcy protection in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign companies shipping to the US, including Hanwha, were forced to reevaluate their supply chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have factories in Korea and Malaysia that were impacted by that duty,\" said Scott Moskowitz, the director of strategy and market intelligence at Qcells. \"The US was our largest market, and we had long wanted to build a factory here. But that trade policy jump-started us making the investment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Qcells' latest expansion plans were buoyed by the Inflation Reduction Act. The law authorized big tax credits for companies making renewable-energy technologies, including solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those subsidies could increase if companies use what's known as domestic content: components of those technologies that are also sourced from the US. The Treasury Department is still working on final guidance for which components would qualify. An initial draft covers solar modules and cells but not wafers and polysilicon. In February, a dozen senators, including Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, asked the Biden administration to include wafers and polysilicon to help reshore more of the solar-panel supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "That change would benefit Qcells. Its parent company, Hanwha, invested in a polysilicon factory in Washington state, reviving operations after a nearly five-year hiatus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moskowitz said that though the law has spurred the most investment in US manufacturing in decades, these renewable supply chains still face headwinds, primarily from China. He added that China had compensated for its cratering real-estate sector by rapidly investing in export-oriented manufacturing inside and outside its borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to BloombergNEF, China spent $676 billion on the green-energy transition in 2023, while the US spent $303 billion. The year prior, China spent $546 billion while the US spent $141 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, China dominates the renewable-energy supply chain, from metals to polysilicon to solar components to batteries. The investment has also led to a global oversupply of solar panels and components that's sent prices plunging, and it's made China a major player in the EV market.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the US doesn't import solar panels directly from China, the Biden administration last year determined that certain Chinese companies were shipping products through Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Vietnam. This allowed those companies to avoid tariffs, which the administration had waived for two years, through June 2024. According to S&P Global, the US imported more than two-thirds of its solar panels from Southeast Asia last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moves reflect the delicate balance the White House is trying to strike between meeting its climate and renewable-energy goals — which rely on imports — and bolstering a domestic manufacturing base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moskowitz said that despite the difficult market conditions, Qcells was committed to its US expansion plans. The tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act are in effect for 10 years, which he said reduced some risk for the company. Qcells also has an eight-year supply deal with Microsoft, which is building out renewable-energy projects to power its operations.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Two years ago, T-Mobile used a relatively new technique known as 5G Carrier Aggregation ( 5G CA) to achieve the kind of 3Gbps download speeds on midband frequencies that had previously been the exclusive domain of extremely high (and extremely short-range) mmWave technologies. Now, it’s chalked up another 5G first by taking advantage of the latest developments to shatter the traditional cap on upload speeds over sub-6GHz frequencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Videos\n",
      "\n",
      "T-Mobile’s newest 5G record\n",
      "\n",
      "The new technique is known as uplink transmit (UL Tx) switching, and it’s similar in basic principle to the 5G CA technique used to reach 3Gbps download speeds, except that it uses more channels to deliver more capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, UL Tx goes a big step beyond that. With 5G CA, T-Mobile combined multiple 5G channels across three discrete frequency bands from 1.9GHz to 2.5GHz to give it more bandwidth. UL Tx switching stands on the shoulders of those carrier aggregation technologies to combine different frequencies into a single uplink band, but then adds single-user multiple input, multiple output (SU-MIMO) to the mix to send multiple streams and seamlessly switch between frequencies to take maximum advantage of all the capacity that’s available across that entire spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use the description from T-Mobile’s press release, “It’s like taking the 5G superhighway and adding new faster lanes with spare capacity for traffic to zoom faster than ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is that T-Mobile has been able to achieve speeds of 345Mbps on its 5G standalone network, breaking its own previous record of 275Mbps that it announced less than a month ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Uncarrier didn’t name the specific smartphone used to conduct the test, saying only that it was “powered by a flagship Snapdragon Modem-RF system from Qualcomm Technologies.” However, some might consider it telling that last month’s record was announced alongside the availability of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This achievement is a testament to our relentless pursuit of innovation and our commitment to delivering an even better network experience to our customers,” said Ulf Ewaldsson, president of technology at T-Mobile. “Uplink transmit switching has the potential to significantly boost upload speeds and capacity, and we implore our partners around the globe to build the capability into the 5G ecosystem moving forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fastest speeds at the best range\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes T-Mobile’s accomplishment so groundbreaking isn’t just the raw speeds it’s been able to achieve, but the fact that it’s done so using midband 5G frequencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve long seen reports of 5G technology delivering download speeds of up to 4Gbps and upload speeds above 1Gbps. A mere 345Mbps may not seem that impressive by comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that those blazing-fast speeds have traditionally only been available on mmWave networks, which operate at extremely high frequencies that typically run above 24GHz. This spectrum offers incredible capacity, but also has a range of about a city block.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s an inverse relationship between range and capacity; as frequencies increase, so do speeds, but the range goes down. On the other end of the spectrum from mmWave, low-band 5G can reach for miles, but you won’t get speeds that are much better than what 4G/LTE can deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the midband frequencies — the ones from 2GHz to 6GHz — have long been considered the sweet spot for the future of 5G . These are also sometimes referred to as C-band spectrum, although that’s not entirely accurate, as the C-band frequencies make up only a tiny portion of that spectrum, specifically a 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz slice in the middle. C-band is used mainly by Verizon and AT&T, while T-Mobile has set up its base camp in the 2.5GHz zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The midband spectrum offers the best balance between range and capacity, but it’s also clear that speeds are beginning to plateau with the limitations of existing 5G technologies. That’s why T-Mobile has been aggressively experimenting with new techniques like 5G CA and UL Tx to change the rules and allow it to deliver unprecedented speeds that don’t sacrifice range.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practical terms, this means the same towers that T-Mobile has deployed today could someday deliver speeds that rival the best mmWave networks without the need to deploy the tens of thousands of additional transceivers necessary to blanket a densely populated city with mmWave coverage.\n",

      "\n",
      "Four miles away from the launch site, a crowd including scientists, engineers, and their families erupted into celebration. They were applauding largely for one satellite on board: MethaneSAT, which is built to detect methane. That's a gas that in the short term packs an even bigger planet-warming punch than carbon dioxide.\n",
      "\n",
      "MethaneSAT – led by the Environmental Defense Fund – will have a targeted focus: to spot methane from the oil and gas industry, which leaks at various parts of the fossil fuel production process. Sometimes oil companies deliberately burn methane gas if they can't pipe it somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reducing methane pollution can help the world meet its climate targets, but for years researchers had little understanding of where exactly methane leaks were coming from. Recent projects have helped give a clearer picture, but the data hasn't always been public, or precise – especially from oil fields, says Steven Hamburg, chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) who led the MethaneSAT project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of MethaneSAT is to have a granular picture of where exactly methane comes from in oil and gas operations around the globe, in places like Texas, Russia and Nigeria. \"For the first time [we'll] have high quality empirical data for an entire sector across the globe,\" Hamburg says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oil and gas industry has historically had a culture of confidentiality, says Antoine Halff, chief analyst at Kayrros, a climate analytics firm. \"They like to keep their data private,\" he says. \"There's, I think, a cultural discomfort with the transparency provided by independent monitoring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When this satellite is fully operational in the coming months, it will provide data that will be free to the public.

      "About 30% of global warming comes from human-caused methane pollution. Mark Brownstein, a senior vice president at EDF, says the question for a long time was how much methane comes from the oil and gas sector?\n",
      "\n",
      "Other sectors also create methane pollution. Agriculture – specifically gas-belching cows and gas-emitting manure – is the single biggest source of methane in the U.S., according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n",
      "\n",
      "But focusing on the oil and gas sector was strategic, Hamburg says. Oil and gas has a concentrated number of players, with bigger budgets to clean up their operations. \"The ability to remediate is much greater and it's cost-effective,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past six years EDF put together a team – including scientists from Harvard University and other groups – to build a satellite to get a better picture of the oil industry. The satellite has sensors specifically designed to pick up the fingerprint of the methane molecule. The sensors now orbiting in space will then send data back to Earth in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hope is that regulators will use this data, Hamburg says. \"There's interest. There's conversations, not just with the U.S. EPA, but in other governments and other regulators,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late last year the EPA made a new rule that for the first time requires oil and gas operators to monitor, detect, and fix methane leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for the EPA said in an emailed statement that the EPA's new rule \"has a mechanism for third-party notifiers using approved remote sensing technologies to be certified – enabling them to notify EPA of methane super-emitter events.\" Super-emitter events happen when large amounts of methane are released. \"EDF, along with other owners of remote sensing technologies, may apply to be certified,\" the EPA said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aaron Padilla, vice president of corporate policy at the American Petroleum Institute, the country's largest oil and gas lobby, says his industry has many years of experience using their own satellites and technologies to identify and then reduce methane emissions.\n",

      "\"Our industry's experience shows that one really needs to use a range of technologies working together across their strengths and weaknesses in order to get a truly accurate picture of where you have methane emissions,\" Padilla says.\n",

      "Ultimately, Hamburg says he hopes that data from the MethaneSAT will move more oil and gas companies to clean up methane pollution.\n",
      "\n",

      "What is machine learning and deep learning? Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that emphasizes the development of algorithms and statistical models. These models enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference. Unlike traditional computer programs where you specify the steps, machine learning presents examples from which the system learns, deciphering the relationship between different elements in the example.\n",

      "Machine learning involves two distinct phases: training and inference. A computer algorithm analyzes many samples or training data to extract relevant features and patterns during the training stage. This data can include numbers, text, images, speech, and videos. The models analyze the data, identify different features in the dataset, and learn to distinguish one thing from another.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different methods of conducting the training stage. The first one, supervised learning, involves learning that explicitly maps the input to the output. Other types of training include unsupervised learning, where the patterns are not labeled, and reinforcement learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inference, the second stage, is the output stage. Here, the model, drawing from everything it learned, is queried about something not included in the training data.\n",

      "Numerous models can be used, and not all are neural networks. However, neural networks, which mimic how the neurons in the brain work, are pretty popular today. These digital neurons are arranged in layers, each having weights and biases. The network adjusts these weights and biases during the learning phase to produce the correct answer.\n",

However, due to marketing strategies, these are often labeled as AI. AI, which originally referred to human-like intelligence in machines, now refers to any aspect of technology that partially shares attributes with human intelligence. In this sense, AI is very narrow and is essentially machine learning.\n",

AGI is currently a theoretical idea with no existing systems. To be considered AGI, a system must learn and apply its intelligence to various problems, even those it hasn’t encountered before. A true human AGI would need to possess consciousness and self-awareness.\n",
