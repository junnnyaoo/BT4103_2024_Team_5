      "\n",
      "Unexpected security issues (41%) and high project expectations (29%) were reported as the top drivers for moving some cloud-based workloads back to on-premises infrastructures. Another major driver was the failure to meet or properly set internal expectations, accounting for 23%.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reflecting on their experience, IT leaders found that the most common reasons for cloud repatriation projects were security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems, and service downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 29% of IT leaders found that moving projects from on-premises to the cloud was more expensive than expected, while 65% said it was financially predictable. The cost-benefit analysis of cloud versus on-premises infrastructure varies greatly depending on the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite previously unsuccessful cloud projects, 70% of respondents are still encouraged to start new projects in the future. Instead of a complete cloud approach, IT leaders would recommend a mix of ‘mostly cloud and some on-premises’ to the CIO.\n",

In the leading role: photons that make quantum bits “fly.”\n",

      "Quantum computers are considered the next big evolutionary step in information technology. They are expected to solve computing problems that today’s computers simply cannot solve – or would take ages to do so. Research groups around the world are working on making the quantum computer a reality. This is anything but easy, because the basic components of such a computer, the quantum bits or qubits, are extremely fragile.\n",
      "\n",
      "One type of qubit consists of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a single electron, i.e. they are at the scale of an atom. It is hard enough to keep such a fragile system intact. It is even more difficult to interconnect two or more of these qubits. So how can a stable exchange of information between qubits be achieved?\n",
      "\n",
      "Flying Qubits\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Konstanz physicists Benedikt Tissot and Guido Burkard have now developed a theoretical model of how the information exchange between qubits could succeed by using photons as a “means of transport” for quantum information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general idea: The information content (electron spin state) of the material qubit is converted into a “flying qubit,” namely a photon. Photons are “light quanta” that constitute the basic building blocks making up the electromagnetic radiation field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The special feature of the new model: stimulated Raman emissions are used for converting the qubit into a photon. This procedure allows more control over the photons.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are proposing a paradigm shift from optimizing the control during the generation of the photon to directly optimizing the temporal shape of the light pulse in the flying qubit,” explains Guido Burkard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benedikt Tissot compares the basic procedure with the Internet: “In a classic computer, we have our bits, which are encoded on a chip in the form of electrons. If we want to send information over long distances, the information content of the bits is converted into a light signal that is transmitted through optical fibers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The principle of information exchange between qubits in a quantum computer is very similar: “Here, too, we have to convert the information into states that can be easily transmitted – and photons are ideal for this,” explains Tissot.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Three-Level System for Controlling the Photon\n",
      "\n",
      "“We need to consider several aspects,” says Tissot: “We want to control the direction in which the information flows – as well as when, how quickly, and where it flows to. That’s why we need a system that allows for a high level of control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers’ method makes this control possible by means of resonator-enhanced, stimulated Raman emissions. Behind this term is a three-level system, which leads to a multi-stage procedure. These stages offer the physicists control over the photon that is created. “We have ‘more buttons’ here that we can operate to control the photon,” Tissot illustrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stimulated Raman emission are an established method in physics. However, using them to send qubit states directly is unusual. The new method might make it possible to balance the consequences of environmental perturbations and unwanted side effects of rapid changes in the temporal shape of the light pulse, so that information transport can be implemented more accurately.\n",

      "\n",
      "Speculating on the implications of such an event, Buterin outlined Ethereum’s readiness to tackle the challenge head-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shielding Against Possible Threats\n",
      "\n",
      "Speculating on the hypothetical scenario of a quantum emergency, Buterin stated, “Suppose that it is announced tomorrow that quantum computers are available, and bad actors already have access to them and are able to use them to steal users’ funds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin argued that Ethereum is already “well-positioned” to give a strong defense against a potential quantum computing attack. He proposed a simple solution involving a hard fork of the blockchain and introducing new transaction types.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The blockchain would have to hard fork and users would have to download new wallet software, but few users would lose their funds,” Buterin explained, outlining the process of recovery in the face of a quantum threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, the main challenge with quantum computers lies in their impact on cryptographic systems such as Ethereum addresses. These wallets are derived from private keys using elliptic curve multiplication. Quantum computers can reverse this process, making elliptic curve cryptography vulnerable. However, hash functions like Ethereum’s keccak remain secure even in such a situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum Computing Resistant Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin elaborated that Ethereum developers plan to introduce a new transaction type as part of the RIP-7560 protocol, enabling transactions from smart contract wallets. When quantum computing threatens security, an Ethereum wallet transaction could expose the user’s private and public keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed transaction type, integral to the quantum-resistant EIP, would use Winternitz signatures and STARKs to transition existing wallets to new validation codes. Based on ERC-4337 account abstraction, a core technology of smart contract wallets, this code aims to prevent private key exposure during transactions, rendering these accounts resistant to quantum attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin also reassured users that those who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are already safe from potential quantum exploits, as only the wallet address has been publicly available. Additionally, he emphasized that the infrastructure required to implement such a hard fork could begin development immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of quantum computing has long been a concern for the cryptocurrency industry, as it threatens blockchain encryption. However, many experts, including those from Google and IBM, predict widespread quantum computing capabilities won’t materialize until at least 2029.\n",

Despite facing challenges in the past year with weak cloud spending, DigitalOcean has shown growth potential. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported a 20% increase in annual revenue to $693 million, with adjusted earnings of $1.59 per share. However, there are concerns about tight spending by customers, as indicated by a lower net dollar retention rate. The company's CEO acknowledged the challenging macro demand environment but remains focused on long-term growth opportunities, including AI and machine learning solutions. The acquisition of Paperspace aims to enhance customer engagement and bring new customers on board. Analysts anticipate revenue growth acceleration for DigitalOcean, with expectations of reaching close to $1 billion by 2026. With a current market cap of 5.3 times sales, there is potential for significant market cap growth if revenue growth accelerates, possibly leading to a 43% increase in stock value.

      "The researchers’ method makes this control possible by means of resonator-enhanced, stimulated Raman emissions.

      "\n",
      "Speculating on the implications of such an event, Buterin outlined Ethereum’s readiness to tackle the challenge head-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shielding Against Possible Threats\n",
      "\n",
      "Speculating on the hypothetical scenario of a quantum emergency, Buterin stated, “Suppose that it is announced tomorrow that quantum computers are available, and bad actors already have access to them and are able to use them to steal users’ funds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin argued that Ethereum is already “well-positioned” to give a strong defense against a potential quantum computing attack. He proposed a simple solution involving a hard fork of the blockchain and introducing new transaction types.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The blockchain would have to hard fork and users would have to download new wallet software, but few users would lose their funds,” Buterin explained, outlining the process of recovery in the face of a quantum threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, the main challenge with quantum computers lies in their impact on cryptographic systems such as Ethereum addresses. These wallets are derived from private keys using elliptic curve multiplication. Quantum computers can reverse this process, making elliptic curve cryptography vulnerable. However, hash functions like Ethereum’s keccak remain secure even in such a situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum Computing Resistant Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin elaborated that Ethereum developers plan to introduce a new transaction type as part of the RIP-7560 protocol, enabling transactions from smart contract wallets. When quantum computing threatens security, an Ethereum wallet transaction could expose the user’s private and public keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed transaction type, integral to the quantum-resistant EIP, would use Winternitz signatures and STARKs to transition existing wallets to new validation codes. Based on ERC-4337 account abstraction, a core technology of smart contract wallets, this code aims to prevent private key exposure during transactions, rendering these accounts resistant to quantum attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buterin also reassured users that those who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are already safe from potential quantum exploits, as only the wallet address has been publicly available. Additionally, he emphasized that the infrastructure required to implement such a hard fork could begin development immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of quantum computing has long been a concern for the cryptocurrency industry, as it threatens blockchain encryption. However, many experts, including those from Google and IBM, predict widespread quantum computing capabilities won’t materialize until at least 2029.\n",

Only then, they argue, will the technology finally be seen as essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve been looking for decades. “Part of the reason it’s challenging is because classical computers are pretty good at a lot of the things they do,” said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1994, Peter Shor discovered one possibility: a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. Shor’s algorithm is powerful and widely believed to beat all classical algorithms; when run on a quantum computer, it has the potential to break much of the internet’s security systems, which rely on the hardness of factoring large numbers. But as impressive as it is, the algorithm is relevant only to a narrow slice of research areas, and it’s possible that tomorrow someone will find an efficient way to factor large numbers on a classical machine, making Shor’s algorithm moot. Shor’s narrow applicability has led the research community to search for other use cases for quantum machines that might actually help make new scientific discoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t want to build a computer just for a single task,” said Soonwon Choi, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Other than Shor’s algorithm, what else can we do with a quantum computer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Preskill puts it, “We have to find those problems that are classically hard, but then we have to [show] that the quantum methods will really be efficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A few times, researchers thought they’d done it, discovering quantum algorithms that could solve problems faster than anything a classical computer could do. But then someone — often the young researcher Ewin Tang — came up with clever new classical algorithms that could outperform the quantum ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a team of physicists including Preskill may have found the best candidate yet for quantum advantage. By studying the energy of certain quantum systems, they discovered a specific and useful question that is easy for a quantum machine to answer, but still difficult for a classical one. “This is major progress on quantum algorithms theory,” said Sergey Bravyi, a theoretical physicist and computer scientist at IBM. “Their result is a quantum advantage for a problem with relevance to chemistry and material sciences.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers are also excited that the new work explores unexpected new areas of the physical sciences. “This new capability is qualitatively different [than Shor’s] and potentially opens up many new opportunities in the world of quantum algorithms,” said Choi.\n",

In the leading role: photons that make quantum bits “fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers are considered the next big evolutionary step in information technology. They are expected to solve computing problems that today’s computers simply cannot solve – or would take ages to do so. Research groups around the world are working on making the quantum computer a reality. This is anything but easy, because the basic components of such a computer, the quantum bits or qubits, are extremely fragile.\n",
      "\n",
      "One type of qubit consists of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a single electron, i.e. they are at the scale of an atom. It is hard enough to keep such a fragile system intact. It is even more difficult to interconnect two or more of these qubits. So how can a stable exchange of information between qubits be achieved?\n",

      "\n",
      "The general idea: The information content (electron spin state) of the material qubit is converted into a “flying qubit,” namely a photon. Photons are “light quanta” that constitute the basic building blocks making up the electromagnetic radiation field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The special feature of the new model: stimulated Raman emissions are used for converting the qubit into a photon. This procedure allows more control over the photons.\n",

      "“We are proposing a paradigm shift from optimizing the control during the generation of the photon to directly optimizing the temporal shape of the light pulse in the flying qubit,” explains Guido Burkard.\n",

      "\n",
      "Unexpected security issues (41%) and high project expectations (29%) were reported as the top drivers for moving some cloud-based workloads back to on-premises infrastructures. Another major driver was the failure to meet or properly set internal expectations, accounting for 23%.\n",

      "After reflecting on their experience, IT leaders found that the most common reasons for cloud repatriation projects were security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems, and service downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 29% of IT leaders found that moving projects from on-premises to the cloud was more expensive than expected, while 65% said it was financially predictable. The cost-benefit analysis of cloud versus on-premises infrastructure varies greatly depending on the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite previously unsuccessful cloud projects, 70% of respondents are still encouraged to start new projects in the future. Instead of a complete cloud approach, IT leaders would recommend a mix of ‘mostly cloud and some on-premises’ to the CIO.\n",

      "“Hybrid cloud infrastructures offer the best of both worlds across both public and private models. Organizations can optimize costs, seamlessly integrate systems, and experiment with innovation projects without compromising on agility or flexibility,” said Calvin Hsu, VP of Product Management at Citrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud technology key to preventing cybersecurity incidents\n",
      "\n",
      "As IT leaders consider utilizing a hybrid strategy, a key consideration is whether cloud or on-premises is the most secure for safeguarding sensitive information. In Citrix’s study, 31% of respondents stated that they had fallen victim to the same number of cyberattacks regardless of whether data and applications were hosted on-premises or in a hybrid environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The experience of security vulnerabilities varied among different organizations, with some reporting fewer incidents on-premises while others experienced more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security is a top priority, and 93% of IT leaders agreed that cloud technologies can help prevent cybersecurity incidents. Moving workloads and cloud repatriation projects can pose a risk, and IT leaders are worried that these projects could make them vulnerable to a cyberattack. With benefits to both cloud and on-premises infrastructures, 50% of these IT leaders currently have projects in both cloud and on-premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s clear that IT leaders are still trying to find the right balance between cloud and on-premises,” Hsu added. “With evolving demands and unexpected changes to priorities, enterprises need a model that allows them to scale resources up or down as required while maintaining security, compliance, and business performance.”\n",

      "Summary: Physicists from the University of Konstanz have developed a method that could revolutionize quantum computing by enabling the stable exchange of information between quantum computers using photons to make quantum bits \"fly.\" Quantum computers are seen as the next evolutionary step in information technology, capable of solving computing problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers. The basic components of a quantum computer are quantum bits (qubits), which are extremely fragile. The researchers, Benedikt Tissot and Guido Burkard, have devised a theoretical model for the exchange of information between qubits using photons as a means of transporting quantum information. By converting the information content of an electron spin state in a material qubit into a \"flying qubit\" in the form of a photon, they propose a paradigm shift in optimizing the control and generation of photons for information exchange in quantum computers. This method involves using stimulated Raman emissions to convert qubits to photons, allowing for precise control over the temporal shape of the light pulse carrying the information. The researchers' approach involves a three-level system that offers high-level control over the direction and speed of information flow, ensuring accurate and efficient information transport. This breakthrough could pave the way for more efficient and high-fidelity quantum computing systems.\n",

      "Summary: Physicists have long sought a problem that would give quantum computers a computational advantage over classical computers. In 1994, Peter Shor discovered a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers, which was believed to outperform classical algorithms and potentially compromise internet security systems. However, the narrow applicability of Shor's algorithm led researchers to search for other use cases where quantum machines could excel. Recently, a team of physicists, including John Preskill, has identified a new problem that only quantum computers can efficiently solve, related to the energy of certain quantum systems. This discovery represents a significant advancement in quantum algorithms, particularly in the fields of chemistry and material sciences.

      "Summary: Vitalik Buterin, in a recent Ethereum Research publication dated March 9, explored the hypothetical scenario of a \"quantum emergency\" potentially arising soon. Speculating on the implications of such an event, Buterin outlined Ethereum's readiness to tackle the challenge head-on. In the event of quantum computers becoming available to bad actors who could potentially steal users' funds, Buterin proposed a simple solution involving a hard fork of the blockchain to introduce new transaction types. This approach would require users to download new wallet software to prevent fund loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main challenge posed by quantum computers to Ethereum lies in their ability to impact cryptographic systems, particularly those using elliptic curve multiplication. While this makes elliptic curve cryptography vulnerable, hash functions like Ethereum's keccak remain secure even in the face of quantum computing. Buterin elaborated on Ethereum developers' plan to introduce new transaction types as part of the RIP-7560 protocol to enable transactions from smart contract wallets that are resistant to quantum computing threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed transaction type would utilize quantum-resistant technologies like Winternitz signatures and STARKs, transitioning existing wallets to new validation codes to prevent private key exposure and render accounts resistant to quantum attacks. Buterin reassured users that if they have never approved a transaction, their Ethereum wallet is already safe from potential quantum exploits, as the wallet address is publicly available. While the infrastructure required to implement a hard fork could begin development immediately, the introduction of quantum computing has long been a concern in the cryptocurrency industry. However, experts, including Google and IBM, predict that widespread quantum computing capabilities may not materialize until at least 2029.\n",

Only then, they argue, will the technology finally be seen as essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve been looking for decades. “Part of the reason it’s challenging is because classical computers are pretty good at a lot of the things they do,” said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1994, Peter Shor discovered one possibility: a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. Shor’s algorithm is powerful and widely believed to beat all classical algorithms; when run on a quantum computer, it has the potential to break much of the internet’s security systems, which rely on the hardness of factoring large numbers. But as impressive as it is, the algorithm is relevant only to a narrow slice of research areas, and it’s possible that tomorrow someone will find an efficient way to factor large numbers on a classical machine, making Shor’s algorithm moot. Shor’s narrow applicability has led the research community to search for other use cases for quantum machines that might actually help make new scientific discoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t want to build a computer just for a single task,” said Soonwon Choi, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Other than Shor’s algorithm, what else can we do with a quantum computer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Preskill puts it, “We have to find those problems that are classically hard, but then we have to [show] that the quantum methods will really be efficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A few times, researchers thought they’d done it, discovering quantum algorithms that could solve problems faster than anything a classical computer could do. But then someone — often the young researcher Ewin Tang — came up with clever new classical algorithms that could outperform the quantum ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a team of physicists including Preskill may have found the best candidate yet for quantum advantage. By studying the energy of certain quantum systems, they discovered a specific and useful question that is easy for a quantum machine to answer, but still difficult for a classical one. “This is major progress on quantum algorithms theory,” said Sergey Bravyi, a theoretical physicist and computer scientist at IBM. “Their result is a quantum advantage for a problem with relevance to chemistry and material sciences.”\n",

In the leading role: photons that make quantum bits “fly.”\n",

      "Quantum computers are considered the next big evolutionary step in information technology. They are expected to solve computing problems that today’s computers simply cannot solve – or would take ages to do so. Research groups around the world are working on making the quantum computer a reality. This is anything but easy, because the basic components of such a computer, the quantum bits or qubits, are extremely fragile.\n",
      "\n",
      "One type of qubit consists of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a single electron, i.e. they are at the scale of an atom. It is hard enough to keep such a fragile system intact. It is even more difficult to interconnect two or more of these qubits. So how can a stable exchange of information between qubits be achieved?\n",
      "\n",
      "Flying Qubits\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Konstanz physicists Benedikt Tissot and Guido Burkard have now developed a theoretical model of how the information exchange between qubits could succeed by using photons as a “means of transport” for quantum information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general idea: The information content (electron spin state) of the material qubit is converted into a “flying qubit,” namely a photon. Photons are “light quanta” that constitute the basic building blocks making up the electromagnetic radiation field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The special feature of the new model: stimulated Raman emissions are used for converting the qubit into a photon. This procedure allows more control over the photons.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are proposing a paradigm shift from optimizing the control during the generation of the photon to directly optimizing the temporal shape of the light pulse in the flying qubit,” explains Guido Burkard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benedikt Tissot compares the basic procedure with the Internet: “In a classic computer, we have our bits, which are encoded on a chip in the form of electrons. If we want to send information over long distances, the information content of the bits is converted into a light signal that is transmitted through optical fibers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The principle of information exchange between qubits in a quantum computer is very similar: “Here, too, we have to convert the information into states that can be easily transmitted – and photons are ideal for this,” explains Tissot.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Three-Level System for Controlling the Photon\n",
      "\n",
      "“We need to consider several aspects,” says Tissot: “We want to control the direction in which the information flows – as well as when, how quickly, and where it flows to. That’s why we need a system that allows for a high level of control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers’ method makes this control possible by means of resonator-enhanced, stimulated Raman emissions. Behind this term is a three-level system, which leads to a multi-stage procedure. These stages offer the physicists control over the photon that is created. “We have ‘more buttons’ here that we can operate to control the photon,” Tissot illustrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stimulated Raman emission are an established method in physics. However, using them to send qubit states directly is unusual. The new method might make it possible to balance the consequences of environmental perturbations and unwanted side effects of rapid changes in the temporal shape of the light pulse, so that information transport can be implemented more accurately.\n",

      "After reflecting on their experience, IT leaders found that the most common reasons for cloud repatriation projects were security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems, and service downtime.\n",

      "Over 29% of IT leaders found that moving projects from on-premises to the cloud was more expensive than expected, while 65% said it was financially predictable. The cost-benefit analysis of cloud versus on-premises infrastructure varies greatly depending on the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite previously unsuccessful cloud projects, 70% of respondents are still encouraged to start new projects in the future. Instead of a complete cloud approach, IT leaders would recommend a mix of ‘mostly cloud and some on-premises’ to the CIO.\n",

      "“Hybrid cloud infrastructures offer the best of both worlds across both public and private models.

      "\n",
      "Cloud technology key to preventing cybersecurity incidents\n",
      "\n",
      "As IT leaders consider utilizing a hybrid strategy, a key consideration is whether cloud or on-premises is the most secure for safeguarding sensitive information. In Citrix’s study, 31% of respondents stated that they had fallen victim to the same number of cyberattacks regardless of whether data and applications were hosted on-premises or in a hybrid environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The experience of security vulnerabilities varied among different organizations, with some reporting fewer incidents on-premises while others experienced more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security is a top priority, and 93% of IT leaders agreed that cloud technologies can help prevent cybersecurity incidents. Moving workloads and cloud repatriation projects can pose a risk, and IT leaders are worried that these projects could make them vulnerable to a cyberattack. With benefits to both cloud and on-premises infrastructures, 50% of these IT leaders currently have projects in both cloud and on-premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s clear that IT leaders are still trying to find the right balance between cloud and on-premises,” Hsu added. “With evolving demands and unexpected changes to priorities, enterprises need a model that allows them to scale resources up or down as required while maintaining security, compliance, and business performance.”\n",
